##Welcome

![Subsonic 3](/images/front.png)

Welcome to our new documentation site. This is a Jekyll blog and I really need your help if you have a few moments. All the files here are editable right through Github - or better yet you can [fork this repo](http://github.com/subsonic/subsonic.github.io) and make changes... then send a pull request.

Long story short: our old documentation site blew up because of spam. We used MediaWiki and I had no idea just how much spam that thing collects! In short - it filled up my hard drive and database with gigs and gigs of spam... eventually shutting down my server.

I rescued what I could and put it here. It's not formatted very well - but that's where you come in. I'll do what I can over the days but I'd love your help.

All of the pages are in the `_posts` directory. Please be sure to reference [Github's markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) page if you don't know Markdown very well.

Thanks!

Rob
