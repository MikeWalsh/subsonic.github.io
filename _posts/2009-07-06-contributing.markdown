# Contributing

!. This effort is aimed squarely at getting work done, not preaching. *Have committed a few patches - at the very least one. Nothing's worse then having to rollback because of an issue with a commit. It's happened and it's not pretty. *Care. A lot of people don't have space in their lives to care about what we're doing - but if you do, that's great. We need that passion to keep us rolling. *Know a lot about stuff. We need people who know what they're doing - I can't put it any other way. *Feel good about changing things quickly. I'm do that - a lot. I get an idea and BOOM in it goes. 90% of the time it's pure inspiration and it's awesome sauce - 10% of the time it sucks. The point is we try crazy stuff and if you like your bread white and your water weak, this isn't your project.  If you're up for it, please forward me your name and Google account info, and we'll chat.
