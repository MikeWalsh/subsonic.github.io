# Sugar Utilities

##[Summary]()

 SubSonic.Sugar is a Utility Class that is our attempt at refactoring the main Utility class that we've been using over the last year, and rather than keep it to ourselves, we thought "why not share with the lovely people". It's also tons of useful utility classes that we think you'll use a lot of. 
Note that in SubSonic 3.0, these are now Extension Methods  *
