# Descriptor

A "Descriptor" in SubSonic parlance is the first string value, no foreign-key field in a database. This value is *assumed* to be some type of descriptive value for the data in that row.   Using a Product table as an analogy - the primary key would (normally) be the first field, the ProductName would be the second. SubSonic would consider ProductName to be the Descriptor and would use that for linking and display purposes.
