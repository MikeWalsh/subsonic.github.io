# Submit Patch



<h2>Summary== The Concept of "patching" is a little different with Github and Git. If you've never used Git before, you might need to brush up a bit on it. Once you do it, however, it's very, very simple and extremely helpful!  ==Getting to Know Github== This screencast will walk you through all you need to know to get working with Github and Git. It lasts about 10 minutes or so and you'll learn a bunch of new stuff!  <ag>git.flv</ag>  ==Github Issue Tracker Integration</h2>

 Additionally, you can follow the convention of appending "Closes #1" (where 1 is the issue number) to your Commit messages. Github will automatically mark that Issue as Resolved!
