# Installing SubSonic



<h2>Setting up SubSonic 2.x</h2>

 In versions 2.2 and before there was a small amount of work to get SubSonic setup properly with your application. This involved adding a Provider to your Web.config and then setting up your connection strings. It's not too detailed.  
.  

<h2>Setting up SubSonic 3.0</h2>

 SubSonic 3.0 is written in (and therefore requires) .NET 3.5. The installation has been streamlined to literally dropping a folder into your application and editing a T4 file (_Settings.TT) to let it know which connection string to use.
