# T4 Templates

##[Summary]()

 T4 stands for "Text Template Transformation Toolkit" and, simply put, is code generation inside Visual Studio.  It's very easy to work with if you're familiar with scripting ASP.NET pages - except that it works with a  syntax rather than . Another thing to remember is that you're working with Visual Studio - not your project. The templates run in a completely different AppDomain - so you can't use your project's configuration without doing a little gymnastics.  To get you started, I made a screencast - complete with some music from Rush:  <ag> t4.flv </ag>
