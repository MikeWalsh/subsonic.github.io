# Questions



<h2>Summary== You will need help when using SubSonic - we know that. We want to make this as easy as possible (for both of us) so here are some options for you...  ==Search The Wiki== This wiki has taken some serious time and effort to build and there are a lot of answers in here. You can most likely find your answer here.  If you can't - please register and then create a Stub of a page, marking it as incomplete:{{Incomplete}}  We'll see it and make sure that it gets updated.  ==Search The Old Forums</h2>

 We took our old forums offline and moved everything to StackOverflow. If you have a question you can use our 
 and all of our old threads will be searched. This is especially helpful for SubSonic 2.x and older issues.  

<h2>Ask a Question on StackOverflow</h2>

 There are a whole lot of people who monitor the 
 tag on StackOverflow - myself included. You can ask a question and get an answer usually within 30 minutes. Make sure you tag your question with SubSonic!  

<h2>Use our Mailing List</h2>

 If you have a suggestion or just want to get ahold of the developers - you can use our mailing list which is subsonicproject at googlegroups.com. It won't be as fast as StackOverflow and should be used for suggestions or thoughts.
